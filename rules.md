----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 101 (Immutable)

      All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of rules 101-116 (immutable) and
      201-219 (mutable).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 102 (Immutable)

      Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the
      200's are mutable.  Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted
      (that is, changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may
      be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules
      in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 103 (Immutable)

      At any time, each player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker; no
      player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker.  At any time
      there shall be exactly one Speaker.  The term "player" in the rules
      shall specifically include both the Voters and the Speaker.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 104 (Immutable)

      The Speaker for the first game shall be AlexCheese.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 105 (Immutable)

      A rule change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment, repeal,
      or amendment of a mutable rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable rule into a mutable rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all new
      rules are mutable; immutable rules, as long as they are immutable,
      may not be amended or repealed; mutable rules, as long as they are
      mutable, may be amended or repealed; any rule of any status may be
      transmuted; no rule is absolutely immune to change.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 106 (Immutable)

      All rule changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number
      of votes and quorum is achieved.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 107 (Immutable)

      Any proposed rule change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted, it
      must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 108 (Immutable)

      No rule change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 109 (Immutable)

      The Speaker shall give each proposed rule change a number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each rule change
      proposed in the proper way shall receive the next successive
      integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.
        If a rule is repealed and reenacted, it receives the number of the
      proposal to reenact it.  If a rule is amended or transmuted, it
      receives the number of the proposal to amend or transmute it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 111 (Immutable)

      In a conflict between a mutable and an immutable rule, the
      immutable rule takes precedence and the mutable rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this rule a proposal to
      transmute an immutable rule does not "conflict" with that immutable
      rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 112 (Immutable)

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may be
      enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 113 (Immutable)

      A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than
      continue to play or incur a game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the player to incur it, may be imposed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 114 (Immutable)

      There must always be at least one mutable rule.  The adoption of
      rule changes must never become completely inpermissible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 115 (Immutable)

      Rule changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply
      rule changes are as permissible as other rule changes.  Even
      rule changes that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible.
      No rule change or type of move is impermissible solely on account of
      the self-reference or self-application of a rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 116 (Immutable)

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules,
      which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 201 (Mutable)

      Quorum for a proposed rule change is defined to be 20% of Voters
      at the beginning of the prescribed voting period for that proposal

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 202 (Mutable)

      All players begin with 0 points.  Points may not be gained, lost, or
      traded except as explicitly stated in the rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 203 (Mutable)

      The winner is the first Voter to achieve 100 (positive) points.
      If more than one Voter achieves this condition simultaneously, all
      such Voters win.
      When a game ends in this manner:
        -If there is only one winner, that Voter becomes the Speaker, and
         the old Speaker becomes a Voter
        -If there is more than one winner, the Speaker randomly selects
         one of the winners, who becomes the new Speaker, and the old
         Speaker becomes a Voter.
        -All players' scores are reset to 0.
        -A new game is begun.  All rules and proposed rule changes retain
         the status they had at the end of the old game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 204 (Mutable)

      A proposal shall be made by submitting it to the Speaker.  Only
      Voters may make proposals.  As soon as possible after receiving
      a proposal, the Speaker shall assign the proposal a number and
      distribute the proposal along with its number to all players

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 206 (Mutable)

      Each Voter has exactly one vote.  The Speaker may not vote.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 207 (Mutable)

      Voters may vote either for or against any proposal within its
      prescribed voting period.  In order to be legally cast, the vote
      must be received by the Speaker by the end of the prescribed voting
      period.  The Speaker may not reveal any votes until the end of the
      prescribed voting period.  Any Voter who does not legally vote within
      the prescribed voting period shall be deemed to have abstained.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 208 (Mutable)

      At the end of the prescribed voting period on a proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all votes legally cast on that proposal.  If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a proposal to be adopted,
      then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or not e gives
      eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly indicate that e
      refuses to consent to the proposal, it shall be assumed that e
      consents.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 209 (Mutable)

      The required votes for a proposal to be adopted is as follows:
          For a proposal which would directly alter the actions which are
          required of and/or forbidden to the Speaker:
                 a) a simple majority of all votes legally cast, if the
                    Speaker consents;
                 b) a 2/3 majority of all votes legally cast, if the
                    Speaker does not consent;
          For all other proposals, a simple majority of votes legally cast.
      This rule defers to rules which set the required number of votes
      for proposals which propose to transmute a rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 210 (Mutable)

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 212 (Mutable)

      If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule
      with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself
      that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence
      over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall
      supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.
        If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or
      defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 213 (Mutable)

      If players disagree about the legality of a move or the
      interpretation or application of a rule, then a player may invoke
      judgement by submitting a statement for judgement to the Speaker.
      Disagreement, for the purposes of this rule, may be created by the
      insistence of any player.  When judgement is invoked, the Speaker
      must, as soon as possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.
      The Speaker must then distribute the statement to be judged, along
      with the identity of the Judge, to all players.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 215 (Mutable)

      After the Speaker has distributed the statement to be judged and the
      identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week in which to deliver a
      legal judgement.  If the Judge fails to deliver a judgement within
      this time, e is penalized 10 points and a new Judge is selected.
      A judgement is delivered by submitting that judgement to the
      Speaker, who must then distribute that judgement to all players
      as soon as possible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 217 (Mutable)

      All judgements must be in accordance with the rules; however, if
      the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the statement
      to be judged, then the Judge shall consider game custom and the
      spirit of the game before applying other standards.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 219 (Mutable)

      If a player believes that the rules are such that further play is
      impossible, or that the legality of a move cannot be determined with
      finality, or that a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the
      player may invoke judgement on a statement to that effect.  If the
      statement is judged TRUE, then the player who invoked judgement
      shall be declared the winner of that game, and the game ends, with
      no provision for starting another game.
        This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the
      winner of the game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 308 (Mutable)

      If judgement was invoked by a Voter, then the first Judge to be
      selected to judge that statement shall be the Speaker.  If judgement
      was invoked by the Speaker, the first Judge to be selected shall be
      a randomly selected Voter.
        In all cases, if a Judge beyond the first must be selected to judge
      a statement, it shall be a randomly selected Voter who has not yet been
      a Judge for the statement. The Voter thus selected may not be the player
      who invoked judgement, nor the player whose action is being called into
      question (if applicable). If all such Voters have been Judge, the Speaker
      will be Judge.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 309 (Mutable)

      The speaker must notify all players on the last day of the voting period
      for each rule change proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 312 (Mutable)

**Jail**

      Jail exists now. If a player is in jail they can't vote or speak in ⁠general-discussion.
      They must speak in "# jail" only. Players in jail cannot be a Judge. If a speaker goes
      to Jail they are let out of jail on parole to perform their duties.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 313 (Mutable)

**Speaker Duties**

      In addition to duties which may be listed elsewhere in the rules,
      the Speaker shall have the following duties:
        -register new players
        -maintain a list of all players and their current scores, and
         make such a list available to all players
        -maintain a complete list of the current rules, and make such a
         list available to all players
        -make a random determination whenever such determination is
         required by the rules.
       -maintain a list of each judgement alongside its original
         statement, its chosen judge, its verdict, and its potential 
         reasons (if given).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 314 (Mutable)

      Rules can be authored by any number of Voters. Any points that would be gained or
      lost by the author upon the proposal passing or failing will be divided across the
      co-authors equally, rounded to the nearest whole number.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 315 (Mutable)

**Legal Judgements**

      A legal judgement is either TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDED.  The
      judgement must be accompanied by reasons and arguments.  If a
      judgement is accompanied by reasons and arguments, the Speaker must
      distribute the reasons and arguments along with the judgement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 318 (Mutable)

**Mr. President**

      All players must exclusively refer to the president by calling them "Mr. President".
      The first president will be the player who casted the 3rd vote in favor of this rule.
      
      Penalty: Admit to being a moron
      Statute of Limitations: 5 minutes

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 325 (Mutable)

      Court exists now. If a player is convicted GUILTY of a crime/rule in court, they incur
      the penalty of said crime/rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 327 (Mutable)

      The prescribed amendment period for new proposals shall be one day (24 hours),
      beginning at the time the Speaker first distributes the proposal to
      all players. During this time, the proponent(s) of the proposal may
      make any changes to it by submitting them to the Speaker. The Speaker
      will distribute the amended proposal as e did the original.
        The prescribed voting period for a proposal shall be two days (48 hours),
      beginning at the conclusion of the amendment period for that proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 330 (Immutable)

**Bundled Proposals**

      1. A single proposal may contain multiple rule changes, hereafter referred to as a
      "bundled proposal". All rule changes within a bundled proposal shall be voted on
      collectively, with a single vote determining the adoption or rejection of all
      included changes.

      2. Numbering: This rule takes precedence over the rule governing the assignment of
      numbers to proposed rule changes for bundled proposals. The Speaker shall assign
      a single proposal number to the bundled proposal. Each individual rule change within
      the bundle shall be labeled with a letter (e.g., 381a, 381b, 381c) for reference.

      3. Voting: The rules governing voting procedures and required majorities shall apply to
      the bundled proposal as a whole. The voting requirements and Speaker's consent (if applicable)
      shall be determined based on the most stringent requirements of any individual rule
      change within the bundle.

      4. Point Allocation: For the purposes of point allocation, a bundled proposal shall be
      treated as a single proposal. The proposer(s) shall receive or lose points once, based
      on the adoption or rejection of the entire bundled proposal, not for each individual
      rule change within it.

      5. Adoption: If a bundled proposal is adopted, all rule changes within it shall take effect
      simultaneously at the moment of the completion of the vote, in accordance with the rule
      governing when adopted rule changes take effect.

      6. Rejection: If a bundled proposal is rejected, none of the rule changes within it shall
      take effect.

      This rule does not alter the existing definition of a rule change, nor does it change
      the requirement that all proposed rule changes must be written down before being voted on.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 333 (Mutable)

      Rule changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a proposal to take effect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 334 (Mutable)

**Point Allocation**

      Players whose proposals are adopted shall receive a number of points
      equal to the number of Voters which voted in favor of that proposal. 
      Players whose proposals are not adopted shall lose 10 points.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 336 (Mutable)

## Rule 336 (Mutable)
# Prefire Voting

      1. During the prescribed amendment period for a proposal, players may submit a prefire vote to the Speaker.

      2. A prefire vote shall consist of:
         a) The player's vote (for or against the proposal)
         b) The proposal number to which the vote pertains

      3. The Speaker shall maintain a confidential record of all prefire votes received.

      4. Players may modify their prefire vote for a given proposal at any time during the amendment period by submitting a new prefire vote to the Speaker. The most recent prefire vote shall supersede all previous prefire votes for that proposal.

      5. At the commencement of the voting period:
         a) All valid prefire votes shall automatically become active votes.
         b) The Speaker shall include these votes in the tally along with any votes cast during the regular voting period.

      6. Once the voting period begins, prefire votes may not be changed or withdrawn except through the standard voting procedures.

      7. Prefire votes do not alter the prescribed voting period. Players who have not submitted a prefire vote retain the right to vote during the entire voting period.

      8. The Speaker shall not reveal any information about prefire votes, including their existence or count, until the end of the prescribed voting period.

      9. In case of any conflict between this rule and existing rules regarding voting procedures, this rule takes precedence only in matters specifically relating to prefire voting.

      10. This rule does not alter any existing requirements for vote validity, quorum, or majority as defined in other rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
